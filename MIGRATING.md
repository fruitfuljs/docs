# Migrating your package

We aim to make migrating your package an easy and straight-forward process. 
To get started, open an issue in this repository. There's no set template for
it, but you could title it something like `Request for Migration`. The body
could look something like this:

```md
Hello, I would like to migrate [REPOSITORY] to Fruitful.
```

That's all - you don't need to explain yourself for wanting to hand over
maintenance. We understand, that's why we're here. Of course, you can add a
description of what your project is about or anything you'd like, really.

After you've made your request, one of our owners is going to invite you into
our GitHub organization. At this point, you should be able to transfer your
repository using GitHub's included tools.

Of course, your repository is going to enjoy the same benefits that all others
have, such as access to our tooling (Danger, Greenkeeper, Travis, etc.) and our
community.
