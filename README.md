# Fruitful

## Who are We?

Fruitful is a community of *volunteers* who are joining forces to maintain
adopted or abandoned JavaScript packages.

## Why?

We are convinced that everything you put into your `package.json`,
`yarn.lock` or `bower.json` should have more than *one* maintainer.
It should have some guarantees that tomorrow, or in a week it will still
be there in equal or better quality. If you, at some point, decide to abandon
maintenance for your project, we are going to ensure that it doesn't just die
a slow death.

Also, by entrusting your project to Fruitful, you gain the help of a lot of
diversely talented people. We know that open source development is hard!
That's why we're crowd-sourcing it.

## How?

Being a community of volunteers, we highly rely on two things: more volunteers,
and, robots. Every contributor is offered an
[invite](https://github.com/Moya/Aeryn) by a friendly robot.

## What?

We accept projects of any size and of any niche. If you have a personal or
professional need for a project, then there might be other people who have
a similar interest in seeing that project NOT die.
