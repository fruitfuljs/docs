## Who are We?

Fruitful is a community of *volunteers* who are joining forces to maintain adopted or abandoned JavaScript packages.

## Why?

We are convinced that everything you put into your `package.json`, `yarn.lock` or `bower.json` should have more than *one* maintainer.
It should have some guarantees that tomorrow, or in a week it will still be there in equal or better quality.

## How?

Being a community of volunteers, we highly rely on two things: more volunteers, and, robots.
Every contributor is offered an [invite](https://github.com/Moya/Aeryn) by a friendly robot.
