# Maintenance

### What happens when a project is first transferred to fruitful.js?
When a project is first transferred to fruitful.js it will:

- Adopt our code of conduct and enforcement policy
- Move to the fruitfuljs GitHub organisation
- Get listed on the fruitful.js project website.

You can read more about the transfer process on the [migrating](MIGRATING.md)
page.

### What does day-to-day maintenance by fruitful.js look like?

- Managing an issue tracker
- Keeping dependencies up to date (with the help of https://greenkeeper.io/)
- Fixing reported bugs & security issues
- Responding to feature requests
- Improving and updating documentation and automated tests

### Stopping maintenance
If a project in unused or we're no longer able to support it, we may decide to
stop maintaining it. If this happens, we'll clearly mark the project as
unmaintained or deprecated in it's README.

If someone outside the fruitful.js project wants to continue maintaining the
project and forks it, we can update the README to point to the maintained fork.
