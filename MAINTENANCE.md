# Maintenance

### What happens when a project is first transferred to fruitful?
When a project is first transferred to fruitful it will:

- Adopt our code of conduct and enforcement policy
- Move to the fruitful GitHub organisation
- Update to use fruitful's standards for testing, linting, documentation, etc.
- Get listed on the fruitful project website.
- Once in shape, a new release should be made in its old namespace, that deprecates it, and points to the new namespace.

You can read more about the transfer process on the [migrating](MIGRATING.md) page.

### What does day-to-day maintenance in the fruitful community look like?

- Managing the issue tracker
- Keeping dependencies up to date (with the help of https://greenkeeper.io/)
- Fixing reported bugs & security issues
- Responding to feature requests
- Improving and updating documentation and automated tests

### Stopping maintenance
If a project is unused or we're no longer able to support it, we may decide to stop maintaining it.
If this happens, we'll clearly mark the project as unmaintained or deprecated in its README.

If someone outside the fruitful project wants to continue maintaining the project and forks it, we can update the README to point to the maintained fork.
